This code controls a WT588D with an Ardiuno in 3 wire mode for a Minions Operation (Despicable Me) game.

It plays a random minions sample, lights an LED and runs a motor and plays nag tunes if you forget to turn it off (something you don't need to do with the unmodified game!).

I'm not including the Minions samples for copyright reasons. This is just for fun because I was disapointed that the official game didn't already do it. You missed a trick Hasbro! (And wasn't Operation made by MB games originally or did I imagine that?)

See http://www.makebournemouth.com/?p=714 for the proto type in operation (no pun intended).
